<h1 align='center'> Fashion Classification </h1>

<h4 align='center'> The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and accurate fashion classification model capable of identifying different types of clothing items from images. This model will utilize a sequential neural network architecture, leveraging the power of TensorFlow and Keras frameworks. </h4>

#### Dataset:

To train and evaluate our model, we will employ a publicly available fashion dataset consisting of a large number of grayscale images representing various clothing items. This dataset will provide a diverse and representative sample of the fashion domain.

#### Model Architecture:

A sequential neural network will be the foundation of our model. This architecture is well-suited for tasks involving sequential data, such as image classification where pixels can be considered as a sequence. The model will consist of multiple layers, including:

**Convolutional Layers:** These layers will extract relevant features from the input images by applying filters.
**Pooling Layers:** Pooling layers will reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps while preserving essential information.
**Flatten Layer:** This layer will reshape the feature maps into a one-dimensional vector.
**Dense Layers:** Fully connected layers will process the flattened features and make the final classification.

#### Libraries and Tools:

The following libraries and tools will be utilized in this project:

**TensorFlow:** A popular open-source machine learning framework for building and training neural networks.
**Keras:** A high-level API built on top of TensorFlow, providing a user-friendly interface for creating and training models.
**NumPy:** A fundamental library for numerical computations in Python.
**Matplotlib:** A powerful plotting library for visualizing data and results.

#### Evaluation Metrics:

To assess the performance of our model, we will employ appropriate evaluation metrics such as:

**Accuracy:** The overall proportion of correct classifications.
**Precision:** The ratio of correctly classified positive instances to the total number of predicted positive instances.
**Recall:** The ratio of correctly classified positive instances to the total number of actual positive instances.
**F1-score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
